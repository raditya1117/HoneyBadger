# Errors in Python
Errors in Python are abnormal conditions that interrupt the normal program execution. In this article, we will discuss the different types of errors and exceptions in Python. We will also discuss how you can avoid Python errors effectively. 


## What are the different types of errors in Python?
We can broadly categorize Python errors into four types.

1. Syntax errors: Syntax errors occur due to invalid syntax, incorrect indentation, or typos.
2. Runtime errors:Runtime errors occur during program execution when the Python interpreter encounters an invalid operation.
3. Logical errors: Logical errors are caused due to error in the logic of the program when the code runs without error but produces incorrect results.
4. File and I/O errors: These errors occur during file operations or input/output tasks.
5. System level errors: System level errors are raised by the Python runtime environment or the operating system due to reasons like memory overflow or interruptions.

Let's discuss all these errors one-by-one in detail, starting with syntax errors.
