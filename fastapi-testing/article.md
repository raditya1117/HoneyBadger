# Error Handling in FastAPI
Errors and exceptions are inevitable in any software and FastAPI applications are no exception. It is imporant to handle errors in a FastAPI applications as errors can disrupt the normal flow of execution, expose sensitive information, and lead to poor user experience. Hence, we need to implement a robust error-handling mechanim in FasAPI applications.
In this article, we will discuss the different types of errors in FastAPI to help you understand their causes and effects. We will also discuss the different ways to implement error handling in FastAPI using in-built methods and custom exception classes. Finally we will discuss some FastAPI error handling best practices to help you build robust APIs.


## What are errors and exceptions in FastAPI?

Errors and exectpions in FastAPI are situations where the normal flow of an application is interrupted due to an unexpected event like invalid input, missing data, or a failed database connection. Errors are caused due to problems in the application logic that prevenets the FastAPI app to execute. For example, trying to divide a number by zero causes an error. 
FastAPI provides a structured way to handle errors using different exception handling mechanisms. In case of an error, the program raises an exception that disrupts the normal execution flow of the FastAPI app. We can then catch the exception, log the error messages, and send a meaningful HTTP response for the given error. If we don't handle the errors properly in the FastAPI app, they lead to `500 Internal Server Error` responses and can stop the execution of the FastAPI app.

Let's dsicuss the different types of errors in FastAPI so that we can implement mechanisms to handle each type of error. 

After discussing the errors and exceptions, we will discuss the different types of errors in FastAPI.

## Different types of errors in FastAPI
