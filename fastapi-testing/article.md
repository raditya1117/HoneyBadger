# Error Handling in FastAPI
Errors and exceptions are inevitable in any software and FastAPI applications are no exception. It is imporant to handle errors in a FastAPI applications as errors can disrupt the normal flow of execution, expose sensitive information, and lead to poor user experience. Hence, we need to implement a robust error-handling mechanim in FasAPI applications.
In this article, we will discuss the different types of errors in FastAPI to help you understand their causes and effects. We will also discuss the different ways to implement error handling in FastAPI using in-built methods and custom exception classes. Finally we will discuss some FastAPI error handling best practices to help you build robust APIs.


## What are errors and exceptions in FastAPI?

Errors and exectpions in FastAPI are situations where the normal flow of an application is interrupted due to an unexpected event like invalid input, missing data, or a failed database connection. Errors are caused due to problems in the application logic that prevenets the FastAPI app to execute. For example, trying to divide a number by zero causes an error. 
FastAPI provides a structured way to handle errors using different exception handling mechanisms. In case of an error, the program raises an exception that disrupts the normal execution flow of the FastAPI app. We can then catch the exception, log the error messages, and send a meaningful HTTP response for the given error. If we don't handle the errors properly in the FastAPI app, they lead to `500 Internal Server Error` responses and can stop the execution of the FastAPI app.

## Different types of errors in FastAPI

Errors in FastAPI are caregorized into various types such as internal server errors, validation errors, and HTTP exceptions. Let's discss the different types of errors in FastAPI so that we can implement mechanisms to handle each of them.

### Internal Server Error
Internal server errors are caused by unexpected runtime issues like logical errors, math errors, or database issues that aren't explicitely handled by the program. For example, if the calculator app running on the FastAPI server tries to divide a number by zero, it will return internal server error due to ZeroDivisionError, as shown in the following example.

///code

### Request Validation Error
FastAPI validates inputs using pydantic models. If an incoming request for a FastAPI server endpoint doesn't coform to the declared structure and parameter types, FastAPI returns request validation error in response.

/// Code

### HTTP Exception

HTTP exceptions are built-in FastAPI exceptions that we can use to raise exceptions and send error responses with standard HTTP status codes. 

///code


### Response Validation Error
FastAPI allows us to specify the structure and data types of all the entities in an API response using response models. Response validation errors occur when the actual return value from an API endpoint does not conform to the schema or type we declare in the response model.

///code

After discussing the different FastAPI errors, we will discuss handling exceptions using different methods.
